# test_paintCode_reichStar
Draw stars rotating on each other, with multply blending mode. 

A test app as part of the EIC app project. 

test purpose: In JUCE, drawing doesn't handle alpha blending modes. I'm considering using a native component for that. I'm generating the drawing code in PaintCode. 
This is an iOS test app that uses the style kit generated by paintCode and uses it in an iOS app.
